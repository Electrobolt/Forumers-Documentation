# Error Handling

The Forumers API provides clear error messages to help you diagnose issues with your requests. Below are common error codes and their meanings.

## Common Error Codes

- **400 Bad Request**
  - **Description**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
  - **Example**: Missing required parameters or invalid data types.

- **401 Unauthorized**
  - **Description**: Authentication failed. The API key is missing or invalid.
  - **Example**: Ensure that you include a valid API key in your request headers.

- **403 Forbidden**
  - **Description**: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it.
  - **Example**: You may not have permission to access the requested resource.

- **404 Not Found**
  - **Description**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.
  - **Example**: Check the endpoint URL and ensure that the resource exists.

- **500 Internal Server Error**
  - **Description**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
  - **Example**: This is typically a server-side issue; try again later.

## Handling Errors in your Application

When making API requests, always check the response status code. Hereâ€™s an example of how to handle errors in your application:

**Example Error Handling**
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.forumers.com/v1/discussions', headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'})

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
elif response.status_code == 404:
    print("Error: Resource not found.")
elif response.status_code == 401:
    print("Error: Unauthorized access. Check your API key.")
else:
    print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")
```
